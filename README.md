Fork of sanni's controller test ROM to add more functionality and simplify the interface.
THIS WILL NOT WORK ON EMULATOR, ONLY ORIGINAL CONSOLE WITH A FLASH CART

## Instructions
Press start to switch between the initial page and the benchmark page<br>
Hold your stick into each notch on the benchmark and press A to move to the next notch<br>
Press L and R to switch between benchmark comparisons<br>
Green means that angle is good, red means that angle is bad

## Changelog from original version
Removed unnecessary menus + text for testing the stick.<br>
Added diagonal values<br>
Changed text to red or green depending on if the angle is good or not<br>
Added extra comparisons such as a perfect hori, and an overlay for both perfect OEM sticks and perfect hori sticks
